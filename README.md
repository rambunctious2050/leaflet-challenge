# leaflet-challenge
# Created a Leflet map showing earthquakes recorded by the USGS.org in the past 7 days (data retrieved on 2/5/21)
## Used Javascript, D3 and Leaflet to plot earthquakes with circle size correlated to the magnitude, and color coded by depth of the earthquake.
### Click on the index.html file to see the map, representative images are saved in the "images" folder
